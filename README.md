# thesis
The simulation of quantum circuit comprising of individual qubits is a subject under study. A tool for simulating quantum circuits with decoherence (energy relaxation and dephasing) is hard to find, especially with precise control over the qubit's decoherence times $T_1$, related to energy relaxation, and $T_2$, related to dephasing. This is a documentation on the basic tool written for my thesis research, with a few examples on how to use it. This package includes the basic simulation tool for noisy or ideal circuits, and notebooks that re-create the results of my research. The documentations includes some basic examples of how to use the tool.

This GitHub repository contains all of the relevant code for my thesis project. 
it will be better documented in this README later on. 
for now, existing data is too big and cant be uploaded to Git. 
it can be found in this google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17hxwDnAG3TVpA-VN73rOFMZOFKskTV6g?usp=sharing
